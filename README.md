### Running the App

The app can be run on an emulator or a physical device.
However, the app requires a camera to function properly, so it is recommended to run the app on a physical device.

To run the app on a physical device, follow these steps:
1. Open the project in Android Studio (or alternative suitable IDE).
2. Connect your device to your computer via USB.
3. Make sure the device has 'developer options' enabled.
4. Run the app using the 'Run' button in Android Studio.

### Google_ml_kit

The app uses the google_ml_kit flutter package to perform pose estimation.
